# About Me

I am 23 years old, not married. I am studying at the university to become an engineering technologist. Next year I'm graduating from university and I understand the environment in which I want to develop. I have skills in mathematics, physics, understanding of algorithms.

I decided that my stress tolerance, interest, and quick learning ability would help me along this path. I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth, besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education.

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
